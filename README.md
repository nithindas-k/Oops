Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in TypeScript
This project is a practical guide to the four pillars of OOP. Each concept is implemented using TypeScript to ensure type safety and clear structure.

*The Four Pillars of OOP*
1. Encapsulation (Protecting Data)
Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data and methods into a single unit (a class) and restricting access to the inner workings. By using the private keyword, we prevent external code from accidentally changing sensitive values, forcing them to use "public" methods instead.

2. Inheritance (Reusing Code)
Inheritance allows a "child" class to take all the properties and methods of a "parent" class. This prevents us from writing the same code over and over again. We use the extends keyword to build specialized versions of a general concept.

3. Abstraction (The Blueprint)
Abstraction focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it. By using interfaces or abstract classes, we create a contract that other classes must follow. This hides complex background logic and only shows the essential "buttons" to the user.

4. Polymorphism Many Shapes
Polymorphism allows different classes to be treated as instances of the same interface, but each class implements its own specific behavior. Even though we call the same method name, the result changes depending on which object is performing the action.
